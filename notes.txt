Any flags past the type converion are just treated as characters to print:
        printf ("%is", 5); prints "5s"
        printf ("%ih", 5); prints "5h"

Errors to handle:
        -input isn't type specified
        -unequal number of arguments and conversing specifiers
        -nonsensical combinations of input? %hhll
        -Would be nice to throw compiler errors but more likely just print error messages.

        %hlhllc throw an error
        What does %lC do?
        -cannot combine any of the length modifiers
        -cannot do %lC or %lS
        -%lD is just a long
        -%lO is unsigned long
        -%lU is unsigned long
        -%lc is C is wchar_t
        -%ls or S is wchar_t converted to multibyte characters as if by wctomb() and printed up to '\0' or precision



errors to fix:
	-Need to use max unsigned to cast to from signed ints, keep track of if it's negative in the t_flags struct. Must handle variable overflow correctly for each datatype.
